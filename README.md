# Escape-from-Sonoran
Video game created in Unity by me and a colleague as a final project of a video game creation course with Unity.

After the coming to power of the war machines, the robots that helped the humans in the battle against them were taken as prisoners in the old work center of Sonoran, under the same desert. Seruel-700, one of these robots, will not give up so easily.

Instructions:

Use the WASD keys to move the player and Space bar to jump. Use the mouse to point and left button to shoot.
